Quick simulation of how social distancing can help, written in Java

If you would like to edit any of the code here to see more accurate results most of the numbers that need to be edited are in the Person class.
RecoveryTime, timeUntilVaccine and amountDistancing can all be edited here for different results. 

The size of the population can be edited in the CFrame class, within a loop towards the beginning of the CFrame method. I currently have the population set to 250 individuals.
